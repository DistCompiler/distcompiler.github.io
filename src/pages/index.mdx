PGo is a source to source compiler that translates Modular PlusCal
specifications (which use a superset of
[PlusCal](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/pluscal.html)) into [Go](https://golang.org/) programs.

# Purpose and motivation

[PlusCal](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/pluscal.html) is a
language for specifying/modeling concurrent systems. It was designed
to make it easier to write [TLA+](https://github.com/tlaplus). In
particular, PlusCal can be compiled into TLA+, which can be checked
against useful system properties (using the TLC model checker). For
example, [here](https://github.com/duerrfk/skp) is a repository of
PlusCal formulations of solutions to the mutual exclusion problem.

[Go](https://golang.org/) is a C based language developed by Google
for building distributed systems. It has built in support for
concurrency with channels, and goroutines, which makes it great for
developing distributed systems.

Currently there are no tools that correspond a PlusCal/TLA+ spec with
an implementation of the spec. PGo is a tool that aims to connect the
specification with the implementation by generating Go code based on a
specification written in Modular PlusCal. The "Modular" prefix
comes from the need to distinguish the description of a system from
the model of its environment, which is needed for model checking.
PGo enables the translation of a Modular PlusCal description of a
distributed system to verifiable PlusCal,
as well as to a semantically equivalent Go program.

# Current status

PGo is a research project that is currently under active development.
It supports compilation of all PlusCal control flow constructs.
PGo also supports a vast majority of the value-level TLA+ supported by TLC.
See the pull requests and issues for documentation of ongoing work.

To try PGo out anyway, check out the <a href="/usage">usage documentation</a> or the current <a href="/mpcal">description of Modular PlusCal</a>.

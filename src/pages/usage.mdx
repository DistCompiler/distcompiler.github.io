In PGo's active-development state, we do not provide stable releases.
To run PGo, the best way is to clone the repository, and, on the master branch, run it via the [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) build tool:
```bash
$ sbt
> run [command-line arguments]
```

See the usage notes below for what arguments the program accepts.

# Usage

The PGo tool's help text reads:

```
PGo compiler
  -h, --help   Show help message

Subcommand: gogen
  -o, --out-file  <arg>
  -p, --package-name  <arg>
  -s, --spec-file  <arg>
  -h, --help                  Show help message

Subcommand: pcalgen
  -s, --spec-file  <arg>
  -h, --help               Show help message
```

It has two subcommands: `gogen` and `pcalgen`.


## gogen

The `gogen` subcommand requests that PGo generate a Go file from an MPCal-containing TLA+ module.
Most customisation of this stage should be done by choosing specific parameters when calling the generated Go code,
so there are only a few options to consider.

- `--out-file` specifies the path to the Go output file, like `-o` in GCC.
- `--spec-file` specifies the path to the TLA+ input file
- `--package-name` allows customisation of the package name of the Go output file. This defaults to a sanitized version of the
  MPCal algorithm name.

## pcalgen

The `pcalgen` subcommand requests that PGo rewrite its MPCal-containing TLA+ input file,
such that it contains a PlusCal translation of the MPCal algorithm.
The only option, `--spec-file`, is the path to the spec file, which will be rewritten.

To insert the PlusCal translation, PGo will look for comments like, give or take whitespace:
```tla
\* BEGIN PLUSCAL TRANSLATION
... any number of lines may go here
\* END PLUSCAL TRANSLATION
```

If it cannot find one of both of these comments in that order, it will give up with an error message describing the problem,
and will not write any output.

# How it works

PGo is a source to source compiler written in Scala. It compiles specifications written in an extension of PlusCal,
called Modular PlusCal (see the [Modular PlusCal page](mpcal) for more details),
to Go programs.

# How to build (for development)

PGo's Scala code builds via an [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) project, with its dependencies managed
by [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
PGo additionally provides a runtime support library for its generated Go code, which lives in the `distsys/`
subfolder. This Go code is a standard Go module, which can be imported via the URL https://github.com/DistCompiler/pgo/distsys.

The main build script is the top-level [build.sbt](https://github.com/DistCompiler/pgo/blob/master/build.sbt).
To build from terminal, run `sbt` in the root directory and use the standard commands provided by the sbt console.
These include `run <command-line args>` to (re-)compile and run PGo, and `test` to run all tests, including Go tests.

The sbt build can also be auto-imported by the IntelliJ Scala plugin, as well as likely any other IDE with Scala support.

PGo's Scala code has managed dependencies on a small set of utility libraries:

- [scallop](https://github.com/scallop/scallop) for command-line argument parsing
- [scala-parser-combinators](https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators) for the TLA+/PCal/MPCal parser
- [os-lib](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib) for simplified file and process manipulation (process manipulation is used during tests)

PGo's test suites additionally depend on:

- the `go` executable. The tests will attempt to find this, probably on the `$PATH` or equivalent, via the JVM's default lookup process.
- [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/) as test framework
- [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org/) for implementing fuzz tests
- [java-diff-utils](https://github.com/java-diff-utils/java-diff-utils) for generating diffs when tests compare big blocks of text

PGo's Go runtime library depends on:

- [immutable](https://github.com/benbjohnson/immutable) for efficient immutable implementations of lists and maps in the TLA+ data model.
  For example, creating a modified map with one different key-value pair should take constant time, rather than copy the
  entire existing structure.
- [multierr](https://github.com/uber-go/multierr) for combining errors.

PGo is tested using OpenJDK 1.11 through 1.16, and Go 1.18.
OpenJDK 1.11+ is needed because of standard API usage.
Go >=1.18 is needed because of generics.

In this section, we'll go over how to verify a load balancer. We'll get PGo's example load balancer specification, compile it to PlusCal using PGo, compile the resulting PlusCal to TLA+ using the TLA+ toolbox, and then verify some invariants and properties of the specification in the toolbox.

1. Download PGo's example [load balancer specification](https://github.com/DistCompiler/pgo/blob/master/systems/loadbalancer/load_balancer.tla).

2. Compile the specification to PlusCal (output in the same file) using PGo with the following command, replacing the example paths with appropriate paths.
   ```bash
   sbt run pcalgen --spec-file systems/loadbalancer/loadbalancer.tla
   ```

3. Open the load balancer specification in the TLA+ toolbox (by going to File > Open Spec > Add New Spec... > Browse...).
   <div class="flex flex-row">
    <Figure src={img_add_new_spec} alt="Add New Spec..." client:load />
    <Figure src={img_browse} alt="Browse..." client:load />
   </div>

4. Press `Ctrl-t` to compile PlusCal to TLA+ (output in the same file).

5. On the left pane, right click on models, select New Models..., and name the new model. The created model is opened on the right pane.
   <div class="flex flex-row">
    <Figure src={img_new_model} alt="New model..." client:load />
    <Figure src={img_new_model_dialog} alt="New model dialog..." client:load />
   </div>

6. In What is the model? on the lower right side, double click on each item and fill in the following values.
   ```
   |   Item      | Value |
   | ----------- | ----- |
   | GET_PAGE    |     1 |
   | NUM_CLIENTS |     1 |
   | NUM_SERVERS |     1 |
   | BUFFER_SIZE |     1 |
   | WEB_PAGE    |     1 |
   ```

   You can vary the values as you see fit.

   <div class="flex flex-row">
    <Figure src={img_value_filling} alt="Value filling..." client:load />
    <Figure src={img_what_is_the_model} alt="What is the model?" client:load />
   </div>

7. Scroll down and expand out Invariants and Properties on the lower left side.
   <Figure src={img_what_to_check} alt="What to check?" client:load />

8. In Invariants, click Add, type in BuffersOk, and click Finish.
   BuffersOk (found on [line 501](https://github.com/UBC-NSS/pgo/blob/master/examples/mpcal/load_balancer.tla#L501)) states that the buffer must not underflow nor overflow.

   <Figure src={img_invariants} alt="Invariants..." client:load />

9. In Properties, click Add, type in ClientsOk, and click Finish.
   ClientsOk (found on [line 515](https://github.com/UBC-NSS/pgo/blob/master/examples/mpcal/load_balancer.tla#L515)) states that the client requesting a web page eventually receives that web page.
   
   <Figure src={img_properties} alt="Properties..." client:load />

   What to check? should now look like the following.

   <Figure src={img_what_to_check_2} alt="What to check?" client:load />

10. Click Run TLC on the model. (the green circle with a white triangle that looks like a play button)

    <Figure src={img_run_tlc_on_the_model} alt="Run TLC on the model..." client:load />

    Below is an example output.

    <Figure src={img_results} alt="Results" client:load />

    The output shows that TLC ran for 6 seconds in breath-first search mode. It found 3033 states, out of which 1274 states are distinct (visited states are not rechecked). The specification satisfies the invariant `BuffersOk` and property `ClientsOk` so TLC output `No errors`.

# Example invariant violation

import img_comment from '../images/usage/comment.png';
import img_reload from '../images/usage/reload.png';
import img_run_tlc_on_the_model_2 from '../images/usage/run-tlc-on-the-model-2.png';
import img_violation from '../images/usage/violation.png';
import img_error_trace from '../images/usage/error-trace.png';

In this section, we'll modify the example load balancer to see an example violation of desired invariant BuffersOk.

1. Open the load balancer specification in the TLA+ toolbox.

2. Comment out [line 234](https://github.com/UBC-NSS/pgo/blob/master/examples/mpcal/load_balancer.tla#L234), which instructs the client to wait until the buffer is not full before sending a message. Press `Ctrl-s` to save.
   
   <Figure src={img_comment} alt="Where to comment" client:load />

3. Recompile the file using PGo.

4. Reload the file when asked to do so in the toolbox.

   <Figure src={img_reload} alt="Reload..." client:load />

5. Press `Ctrl-t` to recompile to TLA+.

6. Open the created model and run it.

   <Figure src={img_run_tlc_on_the_model_2} alt="Run TLC on the model..." client:load />

   TLC shows that invariant BuffersOk is violated.

   <Figure src={img_violation} alt="Violation" client:load />

   The Error-Trace pane shows how BuffersOk is violated. In this case, the client sent two messages to the server, which overflows the network buffer of size one.

   <Figure src={img_error_trace} alt="Error trace" client:load />
